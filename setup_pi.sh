# This script automates the deployment and setup of the Beatnik Pi Provisioning
# service on a Raspberry Pi. It is intended to be run on the target device.
#
# It performs the following actions:
# 1. Checks for root privileges.
# 2. Installs system-level dependencies (python, pip, network-manager, nodogsplash).
# 3. Installs required Python packages.
# 4. Copies systemd service and nodogsplash configuration files.
# 5. Updates paths in the service file to match the deployment directory.
# 6. Enables the new services to start on boot.
